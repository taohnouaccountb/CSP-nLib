### Instructions
1. Compile: make
2. Run java -jar _name_.jar -f [filename] -r -a ac1
	-f [filename]: The URL of the xcsp file.
	-r write the output to './solver_output.csv'
	-a [ac1|ac3|ac2001|nc]
	-s [BT|CBJ|FC|FCCBJ]
	-u [LX|LD|DEG|DD|MWO|dDD|dDEG|dLD]

### HW1
Only used the code and library given in the course webpage. 

Jan. 23, 2018

### HW2
imported the library opencsv to export the data into CSV. So library jar files are required to compile. 

Added 'export data' function.

### HW2 Checkpoint 2
Added AC3 & AC3.1

Observation: The check counts of AC3 is significantly reduced comparing to AC1. But AC3 is hard to be executed parallel, so CPU time is longer than AC1 on some small cases.

### HW3 Checkpoint 1
Added BT LX|LD|DEG|DD

### HW3 Checkpoint 2
Added WMO

Observation: One thing can be confirmed is that the variable heuristic has a strong effect on the efficiency of the BT search. DEG is somehow slower than other heuristics. DD might be the most efficient one.

### HW4 Checkpoint 1
Added CBJ

### HW4 Final
Fixed the bug in DEG, DDR and MWO

### HW5 Checkpoint 1
Added FC
Program need reconstitution to add the dynamic ordering heuristic.

### HW5 Final
Added dynamic variables ordering dDD/dLD/dDEG

Observation: Dynamic ordering heuristic is significantly better than static ordering herustic. The domino effect make it better.
   Time consuming: BT is slower than both CBJ and FC. In most cases, FC is faster than CBJ, but it does exist some cases that FC is slower. When FC is used with dynamic ordering, it becomes faster.

### HW6 Checkpoint1
Finished FC-CBJ and WMO variable heuristic.

### HW6 
Fixed bugs in FC-CBJ.
Comparing results are in the excel on cse-wiki.
