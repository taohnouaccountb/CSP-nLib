### Instructions
1. Compile: make
2. Run java -jar _name_.jar -f [filename] -r -a ac1
	-f [filename]: The URL of the xcsp file.
	-r write the output to './solver_output.csv'
	-a [ac1|ac3|ac2001|nc]
	-s [BT]
	-u [LX|LD|DEG|DD]

### HW1
Only used the code and library given in the course webpage. 

Jan. 23, 2018

### HW2
imported the library opencsv to export the data into CSV. So library jar files are required to compile.

### HW2 Checkpoint 2
Added AC3 & AC3.1

Observation: The check counts of AC3 is significantly reduced comparing to AC1. But AC3 is hard to be executed parallel, so CPU time is longer than AC1 on some small cases.

### HW3 Checkpoint 1
Added BT LX|LD|DEG|DD
